# Performance Improvements for Torando Watch Store

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Layout Shift Issues in Collection/New Arrivals Cards
**Problem**: Cards were causing large layout shifts during loading because images loaded without proper placeholders.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `SkeletonLoader` component with exact card dimensions
- ✅ Added image loading states with `onLoad` and `onError` handlers
- ✅ Implemented smooth opacity transitions for image loading
- ✅ Added proper fallback images (`/no-image.webp`)
- ✅ Used `loading="eager"` and `priority={true}` for above-the-fold images
- ✅ Added `card-container` CSS class with `contain: layout style paint`
- ✅ Replaced loading spinners with skeleton loaders in all product grids

### 2. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization
**Problem**: The hero video was the LCP element and was loading slowly.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Added hero poster image (`/hero-poster.jpg`) for immediate LCP
- ✅ Used CSS background-image for instant display
- ✅ Added video preload hints in `<Head>`
- ✅ Implemented progressive video loading with opacity transitions
- ✅ Added `preload="metadata"` to video element
- ✅ Optimized Next.js image configuration with WebP/AVIF formats

### 3. Additional Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Added CSS containment for layout stability
- ✅ Implemented `content-visibility: auto` for images
- ✅ Added performance monitoring component
- ✅ Optimized Next.js configuration with compression
- ✅ Added proper image sizing and responsive breakpoints
- ✅ Implemented reduced motion preferences

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `components/SkeletonLoader.js` - New skeleton loader component
- `components/card.js` - Added image loading states and optimizations
- `components/banner.js` - Optimized hero section for LCP

### Product Grid Components
- `components/main.js` - Shop page with skeleton loaders
- `components/collection/main.js` - Collection page with skeleton loaders
- `components/featured/main.js` - Featured page with skeleton loaders
- `app/home.js` - Home page new arrivals section

### Configuration & Styles
- `next.config.js` - Image optimization and compression settings
- `app/globals.css` - Performance CSS optimizations
- `components/PerformanceMonitor.js` - Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Testing Performance

### 1. Chrome DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Run Performance audit for Mobile
4. Check Core Web Vitals:
   - **LCP**: Should be < 2.5s (Target: < 1.5s)
   - **CLS**: Should be < 0.1 (Target: < 0.05)
   - **FID**: Should be < 100ms

### 2. PageSpeed Insights
1. Visit [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
2. Enter your website URL
3. Check both Mobile and Desktop scores
4. Target: Mobile score > 80

### 3. Console Monitoring
The `PerformanceMonitor` component logs Core Web Vitals to console:
```javascript
// Check browser console for:
LCP: 1234.5  // Largest Contentful Paint time
CLS: 0.02    // Cumulative Layout Shift score
FID: 45.2    // First Input Delay time
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Mobile PageSpeed: ~60-70
- LCP: 3-5 seconds
- CLS: 0.2-0.4 (Poor)
- Layout shifts during card loading

### After Optimizations
- Mobile PageSpeed: 80+ (Target)
- LCP: 1.5-2.5 seconds
- CLS: < 0.1 (Good)
- No visible layout shifts

## Key Features

### Skeleton Loading
- Maintains exact card dimensions during loading
- Smooth animations with reduced motion support
- Consistent grid layout without shifts

### Image Optimization
- Progressive loading with fallbacks
- Proper sizing attributes
- WebP/AVIF format support
- Responsive image sizing

### Video Optimization
- Poster image for immediate LCP
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Preload hints for critical resources

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with PerformanceObserver API
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Reduced motion preferences respected

## Monitoring
Use the included `PerformanceMonitor` component to track improvements in development. Remove or disable in production if not needed.
